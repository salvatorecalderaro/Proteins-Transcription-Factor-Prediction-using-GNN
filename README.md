# Proteins-Transcription-Factor-Prediction-using-GNN
This repository provides an innovative deep-learning methodology designed to predict the presence of transcription factors in protein sequences. The model can accurately classify proteins based on their structural and sequential features by representing sequences as graphs and leveraging the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
