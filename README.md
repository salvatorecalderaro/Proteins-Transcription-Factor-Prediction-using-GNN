# Proteins-Transcription-Factor-Prediction-using-GNN
This repository provides an innovative deep-learning methodology designed to predict the presence of transcription factors in protein sequences. The model can accurately classify proteins based on their structural and sequential features by representing sequences as graphs and leveraging the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

## Datasets

- **All dataset**: Contains 3000 TF and 9000 no-TF sequences sampled without considering the organism type.
- **Eukaryotic dataset**: Contains 3000 TF and 9000 no-TF sequences sampled from sequences belonging to eukaryotic organisms.
- **Prokaryotic dataset**: Contains 3000 TF and 3000 no-TF sequences sampled from sequences belonging to prokaryotic organisms.
- **Virus dataset**: Contains 538 TF and 1614 no-TF sequences sampled from sequences belonging to virus organisms.
